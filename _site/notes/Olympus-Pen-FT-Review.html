The girl behind me in line asked me about my camera. Inevitably the conversation lead to the question so often asked to film photography enthusiasts, “why?”. Why is it that we go through so much effort in order to do something that can be done by pulling out any old phone? To me, the answer to that one worded question is an one worded answer, “choice”. By shooting film I am able to chose from thousands of camera bodies and thousands of lenses; most of which will not put a huge dent in my wallet. The possibilities are almost endless. Not only do I have plenty of choices in cameras, I also have many choices when it comes to film. As someone who considers myself a tinkerer, this is fantastic.</p><div class="divider"></div><p>This leads me to introducing you to one of the most unique cameras I own, the Olympus Pen-FT. Instead of describing to you what makes it unique, let me show you a shot [or shots ] taken with it.</p><p><img src="/Images/Analog - 1/Canoe_sign.jpg" alt="canoe and sign" /></p><p>That is one frame of 35mm film, split into two shots. Thats the magic behind the Pen FT, it’s a half frame 35mm camera, and a damn fine one at that.</p><div class="divider"></div><h2 id="the-pen-fft">The Pen F/FT</h2><p>The Pen F series was first introduced in 1963. It was designed by Maitani Yoshihisa, a legendary camera designer who is also the brains behind the ever-popular Olympus OM line. When it was introduced, the marketing team at Olympus flaunted the Pen F’s compact body all over their ads. One ad even showed a shoe being used as a camera bag to emphasize just how small the Pen F really is. The Pen F was virtually unrivalled in its category; no one else had a competing half-frame SLR system. <br /> <img src="/Images/Analog - 1/PenFT_ShoeAd.jpg" alt="ShoeAd" /></p><p>The camera I have, the Pen FT, is a direct descendant of the original F. Released in 1966, the FT brought TTL exposure metering to the Pen. Based on the serial number on my camera and a chart I found on <a href="http://www.klassik-cameras.de/Olympus_PenF.html">this German camera site</a> the Pen FT I have in my hands was made in 1970 and was one of the later cameras to roll off the line. The Lens I have paired with my FT is an Olympus G.Zuiko 40mm f1.4; a fast normal lens that was likely the kit lens that came with the camera when it was purchased.</p><div class="divider"></div><h2 id="quality-and-handling">Quality and Handling</h2><p><img src="/Images/Analog - 1/PenFT_front.jpg" alt="PenFT_front" /></p><p>Wow was I surprised when I first saw this camera in person. With knowledge of it being a middle of the range camera when released I didn’t expect the level of precision in craftsmanship of this camera. The feel of the camera is completely solid and dense. There is no mucking about with the quality of the dials either, after over 40 years old and they still click right into place. The only flaw I could find on the camera is that the back door does not perfectly align when being closed but this poses no issue other than being a slight annoyance when putting a new roll of film in.</p><p>The look of the camera is sleek and modern, it doesn’t feel too aged at all. I would argue that this camera looks as sleek as any modern camera. The black leather case that came with the camera is also nice. It has a purple velvet liner (reminds me of a Crown Royal pouch) and snap button enclosure.</p><h2 id="performance">Performance</h2><p>To get something off my back right from the start, the pictures taken by this camera are not incredibly impressive image quality wise. I suspect this may have to do with the not so stellar lens mounted on it and the budget film I have been shooting (Fuji Superia 400). Compared with shots with Fuji Superia 400 and my Nikon FM2, the pictures taken by the Olympus are not as saturated. Colours look a tad bland and unimpressive. It is important to remember that the half-frames taken by this camera will obviously have less resolution (half that of a full frame 35mm camera) when scanned or printed and thus loss of image quality can also be attributed to this.</p><p>With this being said, the not too impressive image quality is never on my mind when I am shooting with this camera. Its just too fun. Composing shots with portrait orientation through the view-finder gives a completely alien photo-shooting experience. No longer is the world seen through the camera a mundane 2 X 3 ratio. The fun doesn’t stop at the click of the shutter button either, the satisfaction of seeing two shots side by side in the same scanned frame that complement each other’s theme is swell. Its a mini photo-story, it feels like a piece of art. This I believe is the best part of shooting with a half-frame camera such as the Pen FT.</p><p>The TTL metering in the Pen FT is accurate enough to be relied on. It requires one common drug store battery(Energizer 357) that has lasted me a couple of months already. The meter is unique as it doesn’t display the exposure in EV but rather shows you a number, 1 through 7, that correspond to numbers on the lens. Each number is matched with an aperture stop. This is both good and bad. Good that once you get used to the system, finding the correct aperture to set the lens at is pretty quick. The bad is that you have to make a conversion in your head before you know the exact f-stop number you are used to shooting with in mind.</p><h2 id="return-of-the-half-frame">Return of the half frame</h2><p>Another topic that has been discussed is half-frame camera’s coming of age. With film becoming more and more scarce and the cost of analog photography rising, could the half-frame camera see a rebound in popularity? I believe so. There is now a real advantage to getting twice the number of shots on one roll of film. Throw a 36 exposure roll in a half-frame and it’s going to last quite a while. For the same cost of shooting 36 shots, I can shoot 72. The enjoyment of taking pictures is prolonged for free and who doesn’t love free things?</p><h2 id="sample-images">Sample images</h2><p>The following are a collection of sample photos shot with the Pen FT. The film used is Fuji Superia 400: <br /> <br /><br /> <img src="/Images/Analog - 1/PenFT_Animals.jpg" alt="PenFT_Animals" /><br /> <br /><br /> <img src="/Images/Analog - 1/PenFT_Trees.jpg" alt="PenFT_Trees" /><br /> <br /><br /> <img src="/Images/Analog - 1/PenFT_Camera.jpg" alt="PenFT_Camera" /><br /> <br /><br /> <img src="/Images/Analog - 1/PenFT_Chair.jpg" alt="PenFT_Chair" /><br /> <br /></p><h4 id="the-olympus-pen-ft-is-a-interesting-camera-its-a-pleasure-to-hold-and-use-it-lets-you-take-a-break-from-prioritizing-shots-in-landscape-you-get-to-save-film-and-have-fun-while-doing-so-if-youre-looking-for-a-half-frame-35mm-camera-it-is-the-one-to-get">The Olympus Pen FT is a interesting camera. Its a pleasure to hold and use. It lets you take a break from prioritizing shots in landscape. You get to save film and have fun while doing so. If you’re looking for a half-frame 35mm camera, it is the one to get.</h4></article><div class="back"> <a href="/blog.html">Back</a></div></main></body><script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha512-K1qjQ+NcF2TYO/eI3M6v8EiNYZfA95pQumfvcVrTHtwQVDG+aHRqLi/ETn2uB+1JqwYqVG3LIvdm9lj6imS/pQ==" crossorigin="anonymous"></script></html>
