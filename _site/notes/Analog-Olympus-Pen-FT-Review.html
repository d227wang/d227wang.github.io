The girl behind me in line asked me about my camera. Inevitably the conversation lead to the question so often asked to film photography enthusiasts, “why?”. Why is it that we go through so much effort in order to do something that can be done by pulling out any old phone? To me, the answer to that one worded question is an one worded answer, “choice”. By shooting film I am able to chose from thousands of camera bodies and thousands of lenses; most of which will not put a huge dent in my wallet. The possibilities are almost endless. Not only do I have plenty of choices in cameras, I also have many choices when it comes to film. As someone who considers myself a tinkerer, this is fantastic.</p><div class="divider"></div><p>This leads me to introducing you to one of the most unique cameras I own, the Olympus Pen-FT. Instead of describing to you what makes it unique, let me show you a shot [or shots ] taken with it.</p><p><img src="/Images/Analog - 1/Canoe_sign.jpg" alt="canoe and sign" /></p><p>That is one frame of 35mm film, split into two shots. Thats the magic behind the Pen FT, it’s a half frame 35mm camera, and a damn fine one at that.</p><div class="divider"></div><h2 id="the-pen-fft">The Pen F/FT</h2><p>The Pen F series was first introduced in 1963. It was designed by Maitani Yoshihisa, a legendary camera designer who is also the brains behind the ever-popular Olympus OM line. When it was introduced, the marketing team at Olympus flaunted the Pen F’s compact body all over their ads. One ad even showed a shoe being used as a camera bag to emphasize just how small the Pen F really is. The Pen F was virtually unrivalled in its category; no one else had a competing half-frame SLR system.</p><p>The camera I have, the Pen FT, is a direct descendant of the original F. Released in 1966, the FT brought TTL exposure metering to the Pen. Based on the serial number on my camera and a chart I found on this german camera site (http://www.klassik-cameras.de/Olympus_PenF.html) the Pen FT I have in my hands was made in 1970 and was one of the later cameras to roll off the line. The Lens I have paired with my FT is an Olympus G.Zuiko 40mm f1.4; a fast normal lens that was likely the kit lens that came with the camera when it was purchased.</p><div class="divider"></div><h2 id="quality-and-handling">Quality and Handling</h2><p><img src="/Images/Analog - 1/PenFT_front.jpg" alt="PenFT_front" /></p><p>Wow was I surprised when I first saw this camera in person. With knowledge of it being a middle of the range camera when released I didn’t expect the level of precision in craftsmanship of this camera. The feel of the camera is completely solid and dense. There is no mucking about with the quality of the dials either, after over 40 years old and they still click right into place. The only flaw I could find on the camera is that the back door does not perfectly align when being closed but this poses no issue other than being a slight annoyance when putting a new roll of film in.</p><p>The look of the camera is sleek and modern, it doesn’t feel too aged at all. I would argue that this camera looks as sleek as any modern camera. The black leather case that came with the camera is also nice. It has a purple velvet liner (reminds me of a Crown Royal pouch) and snap button enclosure.</p></article><div class="back"> <a href="/">Back</a></div></main></body><script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha512-K1qjQ+NcF2TYO/eI3M6v8EiNYZfA95pQumfvcVrTHtwQVDG+aHRqLi/ETn2uB+1JqwYqVG3LIvdm9lj6imS/pQ==" crossorigin="anonymous"></script></html>
